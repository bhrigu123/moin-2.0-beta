General
-------

If someone adds a new type of node in the Moinmoin DOM tree:
  
  TODO: add support of new types of node

ReStructuredText
________________

ReStructuredText->DOM converter requires docutils(>=0.5), this must be
in REQUIREMENTS and there must be some message in code if docutils is missing.

Some syntax of ReStructuredText is ignored because it can't be converted to
the current DOM tree(like inline style/classe/templete replacement via directives).
Moin needs some page about unsupported things or changes in DOM tree.

Mediawiki
_________

Mediawiki->DOM converter based on moinwiki->DOM parsing model. Moinwiki parser
has blocks(multiline markup) and inline markup, but Mediawiki has tags that are
inline and can be extended to next lines(until closing tag or end of the file).
This create a problem, for some tags it can be solved by implemented
preprocessor, but it's doesn't work with tags that have multiline
output(like <blockquote>).

There are to ways to fix it:

 * preprocessor must input '\n' before <blockquote> and after </blockquote>
 * parser must be able to start new block(multiline) element after inline lexem.
